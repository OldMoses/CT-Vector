<PLANETD>
Planet information display
Shows primary and all rank 2 planets if there is sufficient space.
Rank 2 are all bodies that directly orbit the primary {rank 1} body.

in the system. After choice is made, the chosen planet's details
will be displayed.

<VECTOR>
Graphic vector input control
Left click to input an active unit thrust vector via the sensor screen.
With mouse cursor within the sensor screen, it is a two step process in 3D mode. 
Step 1: is to pan the mouse cursor around the center of the screen to the
desired azimuth heading, while panning the mouse away from the center to
apply increasing thrust values. Applying a left click when the desired values
are acheived. 
Step 2: if 3D mode is used, likewise pan the cursor to obtain the desired 
polar inclination. Clicking in the green center dot defaults to a zero inclination.
It is also possible to enter azimuth and inclination via the keyboard.
HOTKEY: 'v' for text based input dialog box, best for entering precise thrust.

a different name than the original. 
HOTKEY: 'alt s'

<BRAKE>
Braking thrust control
Left click to apply braking thrust to active unit. NOTE: active unit will
use the same thrust level it had before the command is issued. If no thrust

will not cancel automatically.To acheive a complete stop relative to system
or planet, issue a Flightplan/Hold station/... command.
